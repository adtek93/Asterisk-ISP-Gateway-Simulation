# ðŸ“Œ Project: Asterisk ISP Gateway Simulation

## 1. Description
This project simulates a Telco/ISP environment using **Asterisk** to:  
- Provide a simulated mobile extension (e.g., `0909123123`).  
- Provide a fixed-line DID number (e.g., `02873001234`).  
- Connect to **FreePBX** via **IP Trunk (PJSIP)** without SIP accounts.  
- Support **two-way call routing**:  
  1. `Mobile 0909123123 â†’ DID 02873001234 â†’ FreePBX â†’ Agent 123`  
  2. `Agent 123 (FreePBX) â†’ Mobile 0909123123 â†’ Softphone`  

ðŸ‘‰ The goal is to emulate a real carrier call flow and validate inbound/outbound communication between FreePBX and Asterisk.

## 3. Components
- **Asterisk (ISP/Carrier)**  
  - Manages extension `0909123123` (registered via softphone).  
  - Provides an IP-based trunk (PJSIP) to FreePBX.  
  - Dialplan routing:  
    - **Inbound:** DID `02873001234` â†’ FreePBX.  
    - **Outbound:** number `0909123123` â†’ extension inside Asterisk.  

- **FreePBX**  
  - Configured with IP Trunk to Asterisk.  
  - **Inbound Route:** `02873001234` â†’ Extension `123`.  
  - **Outbound Route:** `0909123123` â†’ Asterisk trunk.

## 4. Testing Procedure

### âœ… Inbound Call Test
1. Register softphone Zoiper/X-Lite to Asterisk with user **0909123123**.  
2. Dial `02873001234`.  
3. Asterisk receives the call â†’ sends it to FreePBX trunk.  
4. FreePBX inbound route for `02873001234` routes to extension **123**.  
5. Softphone registered as **Agent 123** rings â†’ **PASS**.  

---

### âœ… Outbound Call Test
1. Register softphone to FreePBX as **extension 123**.  
2. Dial `0909123123`.  
3. FreePBX matches outbound route â†’ sends call to Asterisk trunk.  
4. Asterisk routes the call to extension **0909123123**.  
5. Softphone for **0909123123** rings â†’ **PASS**.

## 5. SIP Signaling Verification
- On Asterisk, run:  
  ```bash
  asterisk -rvvvvv
  pjsip show endpoints
  pjsip set logger on
