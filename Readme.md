ðŸ“Œ Project: Asterisk ISP Gateway Simulation
1. Description

This project simulates a Telco/ISP environment using Asterisk to:

Provide a simulated mobile extension (e.g., 0909123123).

Provide a fixed-line DID number (e.g., 02873001234).

Connect to FreePBX via IP Trunk (PJSIP) without SIP accounts.

Support two-way call routing:

Mobile 0909123123 â†’ DID 02873001234 â†’ FreePBX â†’ Agent 123

Agent 123 (FreePBX) â†’ Mobile 0909123123 â†’ Softphone

ðŸ‘‰ The goal is to emulate a real carrier call flow and validate inbound/outbound communication between FreePBX and Asterisk.

3. Components

Asterisk (ISP/Carrier)

Manages extension 0909123123 (registered via softphone).

Provides an IP-based trunk (PJSIP) to FreePBX.

Dialplan routing:

Inbound: DID 02873001234 â†’ FreePBX.

Outbound: number 0909123123 â†’ extension inside Asterisk.

FreePBX

Configured with IP Trunk to Asterisk.

Inbound Route: 02873001234 â†’ Extension 123.

Outbound Route: 0909123123 â†’ Asterisk trunk.

4. Testing Procedure
ðŸŸ¢ Inbound Call Test

Register softphone Zoiper/X-Lite to Asterisk with user 0909123123.

Dial 02873001234.

Asterisk receives the call â†’ sends it to FreePBX trunk.

FreePBX inbound route for 02873001234 routes to extension 123.

Softphone registered as Agent 123 rings â†’ PASS.

ðŸ”µ Outbound Call Test

Register softphone to FreePBX as extension 123.

Dial 0909123123.

FreePBX matches outbound route â†’ sends call to Asterisk trunk.

Asterisk routes the call to extension 0909123123.

Softphone for 0909123123 rings â†’ PASS.

ðŸ“Œ SIP Signaling Verification

On Asterisk, run:

pjsip show endpoints â†’ verify endpoint/trunk registrations.

pjsip set logger on â†’ trace SIP INVITE, 100 Trying, 180 Ringing, 200 OK.

Use Wireshark to capture SIP packets for protocol-level validation.
